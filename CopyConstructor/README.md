### Problem statement
#### Understanding Copy Constructors through the below project.
#### Write a program that defines a class containing a dynamic array, uses a copy constructor to perform deep copying of the object, and demonstrates the behavior of deep copy through various test cases.

### Solution
#### Implemented a class that demonstrates the use of a copy constructor for deep copying dynamic memory, preventing issues such as shallow copy and memory leaks.

### Learning
#### A copy constructor is essential when an object contains dynamically allocated memory, ensuring that a deep copy is made when an object is copied.
