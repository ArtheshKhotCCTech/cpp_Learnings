### Problem statement - 
#### Understanding default parameter and function overloading.
#### Create a class Rectangle that can calculate the area and perimeter. The class should support default parameters for the width and height. Additionally, provide overloaded methods to calculate the area and perimeter based on the number of parameters passed.

### Solution -
#### Implemented testcases that I got wrong before.

### Learning -
#### Order of default parameters. Function overloading constraints.
