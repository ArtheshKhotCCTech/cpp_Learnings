### Problem statement -
#### Understanding typecasting through below project.
#### Write a program that demonstrates implicit and explicit typecasting by converting between different data types (int, float, char, double).

### Solution -
#### Implemented implicit and explicit typecasting using static_cast and const_cast.

### Learning -
#### Implicit typecasting occurs automatically when the data types are compatible, while explicit typecasting using static_cast ensures precise control over type conversions. const_cast is used to add or remove const qualifiers from variables.
