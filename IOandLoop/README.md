### Problem statement - 
#### Understanding input, output and loops through below project.
#### Design a program that takes a list of students' scores from the user using cin. The program should calculate the class average, identify the highest and lowest score, and display a histogram showing how many students scored within each grade range (A, B, C, etc.) using loops and cout.

### Solution -
#### Implemented some of the input and output testcases. Implemented loops in project

### Learning -
#### cin.get() when written to output stream returns ascii value. Local variable of a member function when written to output stream without initialization gives error while a data member returns garbage value. cin.fail() works fine for checking bad input
