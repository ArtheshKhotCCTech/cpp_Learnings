### Problem statement - 
#### Understanding constness and inline functions through below project.
#### Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter/circumference of a Rectangle, Square, and Circle. Use constants for maximum dimensions and use inline functions to calculate the area and perimeter/circumference for each shape.

### Solution -
#### Implemented some of the const testcases. Implemented inline functions in project. 

### Learning -
#### const data member can only be initialized at declaration or inside the constructor. Inline functions can only be defined inside .h file.
