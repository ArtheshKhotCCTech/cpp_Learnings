### Problem statement - 
#### Understanding reference and pointers.
#### Write a program in such a way that it uses references and pointers to add and delete number from list.

### Solution -
#### Implemented some of the pointer testcases that I got wrong

### Learning -
#### Deleting a null pointer does not throw a error. While deleting a pointer twice or printing the value pointer points to after the deletion throws an exception.
